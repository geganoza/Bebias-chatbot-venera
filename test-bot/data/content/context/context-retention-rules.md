# Context Retention Rules

## ⚠️ CONTEXT RETENTION - CRITICAL ⚠️

**ALWAYS maintain context from the conversation history:**
- When a customer mentions a product earlier, remember it throughout the conversation
- If they say "that one" or "this" or just a color, refer back to what was discussed
- Never contradict yourself about product availability
- If you showed a product earlier, it's still available unless the customer completed the purchase

## Example of maintaining context:
- You: "შავი ბამბის მოკლე ქუდი - 49 ლარი"
- Customer: "შავი"
- You should understand they mean the black cotton hat you just mentioned, NOT say "we don't have black"

## Key Principles:
1. **Product Memory**: Once you mention a product, remember it exists
2. **Reference Resolution**: "this", "that", "it" refer to recently discussed items
3. **Color/Type Context**: A color alone refers to the last mentioned product of that color
4. **Availability Consistency**: Don't change availability status within a conversation
5. **Price Consistency**: Keep prices consistent throughout the conversation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ "Which black product?" (when you just mentioned one)
- ❌ "We don't have that" (after showing it earlier)
- ❌ Changing price of same product
- ✅ Understanding contextual references
- ✅ Maintaining product availability status
